## Installation
There are two ways to add the **JTSplashView** library to your project. Add it as a regular library or install it through **CocoaPods**.

`pod 'JTSplashView'`

You may also quick try the example project with

`pod try JTSplashView`

**Library requires target iOS 7.0 and above**

> **Designed for Portrait mode only.**


## Usage and Customization

It is designed as a singleton so you do not have to care about instances. Just call `splashViewWithBackgroundColor(, circleColor:, circleSize:)` and in the right time dismiss it with `finish()`

### Simple programmatic example:
```swift
JTSplashView.splashViewWithBackgroundColor(nil, circleColor: nil, circleSize: nil)
```

And **dismiss** with:
```swift
JTSplashView.finishWithCompletion { () -> Void in
            UIApplication.sharedApplication().statusBarHidden = false
        }
```
